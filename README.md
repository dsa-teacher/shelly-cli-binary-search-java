# DSA Lab: Binary Search (Java)

Welcome to your Binary Search challenge!

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Maven installed:
```bash
mvn --version
```

## 1. Build the Project
```bash
mvn clean compile
```

## 2. Test Your Solution
```bash
dsa test
```

Or run tests directly with Maven:
```bash
mvn test
```

## 3. Submit Your Results
```bash
dsa submit
```

## Challenge

Implement the binary search algorithm to find the index of a target value in a sorted array.

**Method signature:**
```java
public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target)
```

- Returns the index of `target` if found
- Returns `-1` if not found
- Array is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order

Edit `src/main/java/BinarySearch.java` and run tests to validate your solution.
